      <h3>Healthy Food</h3>
  <p>
   Healthy food plays a vital role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being.
    It is not just about eating to satisfy hunger, but about nourishing the body with
   essential nutrients that help it function properly.
    A healthy diet provides the energy needed for daily activities,
     supports the immune system, improves concentration, 
     and reduces the risk of chronic diseases.
Eating healthy means consuming a balanced variety of foods that include fruits,
 vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Fruits and vegetables 
 are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that protect the body from illness
  and strengthen immunity. Whole grains such as oats, brown rice, and whole wheat bread provide fiber,
   which aids digestion and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels.
